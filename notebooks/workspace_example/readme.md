The .ipynb files in this folder were automatically generated from the .py files using jupytext. See [generate-notebooks.sh](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/.vscode/tasks/generate-notebooks.sh).

The .py files have explicit cell markers compatible with vscode. This allows you to run the scripts a regular Python files, or run them in a notebook mode within vscode without needed to use a jupyterlab kernel. This is very convenient because it allows you to use all the Python tools provided by vscode.
